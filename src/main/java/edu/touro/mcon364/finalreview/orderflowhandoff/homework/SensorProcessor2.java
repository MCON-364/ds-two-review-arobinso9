/**
 * Homework 2 — Sensor reading processor.
 *
 * A monitoring system receives readings from sensors over time. One part of the
 * program submits readings as they arrive. Another part of the program processes
 * those readings using one or more background workers.
 * --> multiple threads will be submitting and processing readings at the same time.
 *     this is a thread-safety problem, and we need to coordinate the handoff of work between those threads.
 * This class is responsible for coordinating that handoff and for keeping a
 * summary of the readings that were actually processed.
 * --> we need to store the submitted readings somewhere until they are processed,
 *     and we need to keep track of the summary statistics for the processed readings.
 * The important question is not only "How do we calculate the stats?" It is also:
 * "What happens when readings are being submitted and processed by different
 * threads at the same time?"
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - submit(reading) accepts one new sensor reading for later processing.
 *   --> you should put the reading on a thread-safe queue or collection for later processing by the workers.
 * - start(workerCount) starts workerCount background workers.
 *   --> You should create a thread pool and submit workerCount tasks to it,
 * - workerCount must be greater than 0.
 *   --> You should validate the input and throw an exception if it's not.
 * - Workers should process submitted readings until the processor is stopped and
 *   all already-submitted readings have been handled.
 *   --> Your worker runnable should check both the running state and the queue state to decide when to exit.
 * - stop() tells the processor to stop accepting/processing future work and waits
 *   until the workers finish the remaining work.
 *   --> You should set a flag to stop accepting new work, interrupt the worker threads to wake them up if they're waiting,
 *       and then wait for them to finish.
 * - getTotalProcessed() returns how many readings have been processed so far.
 *   --> You should use an AtomicInteger to keep track of the total count of processed readings, and return its value here.
 * - getStats() returns summary statistics for the processed reading values:
 *   count, minimum, maximum, sum, and average.
 *   --> You should use a DoubleSummaryStatistics object to keep track of the summary statistics, and return a snapshot of it here.
 * - Public reporting methods must not expose mutable internal state.
 *
 *
 * Before coding, think about:
 * - Which object or objects represent work waiting to be processed?
 *   --> A thread-safe queue or collection (e.g., a BlockingQueue) can represent the work waiting to be processed.
 * - Which object or objects represent work that has already been processed?
 *   --> An AtomicInteger can represent the count of processed readings, and a DoubleSummaryStatistics object can represent the summary statistics for the processed readings.
 * - Which state can be accessed by more than one thread?
 *   --> The queue of submitted readings, the count of processed readings, and the summary statistics can all be accessed by multiple threads, so they need to be thread-safe.
 * - How will workers know when to keep working and when to stop?
 *   --> The workers can check a running flag to know when to stop accepting new work, and they can also check the queue to see if there is still work to be done before exiting.
 * - What should happen if getStats() is called while workers are still running?
 *   --> getStats() should return a snapshot of the current statistics, which may be changing as workers process readings.
 *       You should ensure that the returned statistics are consistent and not affected by concurrent updates.
 * - Is it better to store all processed readings and calculate stats later, or
 *   update numeric summary state as each reading is processed?
 *   --> It is more efficient to update the summary statistics as each reading is processed, rather than storing all readings and calculating stats later.
 *   This way, you can keep track of the count, minimum, maximum, sum, and average in a single pass without needing to store all individual readings.
 * - If several workers update the same stats, how will those updates stay correct?
 *  --> You should ensure that updates to the summary statistics are thread-safe.
 *  --> alternatively you can keep readings in a thread-safe collection and calculate stats in getStats(), but that would be less efficient and more memory-intensive.
